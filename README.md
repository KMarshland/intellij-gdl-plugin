GDL, or Game-Description Logic, is a common way to encode generalized games. [http://games.stanford.edu/games/gdl.html](http://games.stanford.edu/games/gdl.html) provides a decent introduction.

This project seeks to integrate GDL with IntelliJ. Currently, it only provides syntax highlighting, but it could easily become the basis of something more powerful.
